# Causal-Inference
## The CausalInferenceModel folder contains the following files: 
### 'control_experiment.py' is used to process the experimental and control group data and obtain y1 and y2. 
### 'f_test.py' is used to perform a Granger test on the results of 'control_experiment.py'. 
### 'causal_ predict.py' uses the causal factors to predict the closing price. 
### 'compare_model.py' uses the historical information of single closing price and the historical information of all potential factors to predict the closing price, respectively, and compares the evaluation metrics of the three experiments.
## 'The query_history_k_data_plus.py' file in the DataSetQuery folder downloads the experimental raw data.
